# GROUP PROJECT

# Pac-Man Game - Group 16

## Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic Pac-Man arcade game. This game is developed through Java, and is a final project deliverable for CPSC 219 course at University of Calgary. The primary objective of the game is for the player to navigate a maze, while avoiding the different ghosts and consuming the fruits and pellets. The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses through each round.

## Game Objective

- **Moving Pac-Man**: Use keyboard arrow keys to move the Pac-Man in the maze. 
- **Eat Pellets & Fruits**: Clear the maze by consuming all the fruits and pellets.  
- **Avoid Ghosts**: Avoid all the ghosts in the maze. A life is lost if a ghost catches Pac-Man.
- **Points Structure**: 10 pts for each pellet, 50 pts for each fruit, 200+ pts for each vulnerable ghost.
- **Vulnerable Ghosts**: Eating a fruit gives Pac-Man the ability to eat ghosts - this power lasts for 5 seconds. 

## Rules

- **Lives**: Pac-man starts with three lives.
- **End of Game**: The game ends once all the lives have been lost. 

## Key Features

- **Leaderboard**: Input nickname for every distinct player to record their highest level/points.
- **Advance Levels**: The number of ghosts increases with every level, along with the speed of their movements.
- **Pac-Man Music**: Classic arcade game version of Pac-Man music is played in the background. 
- **Ghost characters**: The characteristics of the ghosts change when they are allowed to be ‘eaten’.

## How to Run the Game

- **Compiler**: Compile the source files and run this on a Java version 22/23 on your system. 
- **Visuals**: Set up JavaFX SDK on your system - make sure JavaFX libraries are executable on your system. 
- **IDE**: We recommend importing the project on IntelliJ IDEA for smooth user experience. Run the main class to play the game. 

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language
- **JavaFX**: GUI system 
- **CS_Git_Lab**: University of Calgary's internal version control system
